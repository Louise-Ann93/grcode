## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

## What I learned

### Challenges I faced:

- I've definitely become accustom to the luxury that is VueJs and Tailwind CSS frameworks. It was like muscle memory to type in a tailwind class just to tweak some margin, in reality it was much back and forth between style sheets. I had to google more basic css than i'd like to admit.
- Importing the font was new to me, it's not something i've done before. Seems simple enough, in practice it didn't want to play ball at first.
- Being on one monitor, just my laptop it was quite difficult to look by eye if my sizing was completely right, too much or too little padding in places?
- At the end i worry i may have over complicated it a little.

### Take aways;

- Great experience again with HTML and CSS, made me realise how comfortable i had gotten and not in a good way.
- Made me excited to take on more challenges.
